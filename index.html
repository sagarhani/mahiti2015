					<h3>Kiss Kill Bite
<span>-Geor ge Solon
3rd ‘A’
</span></h3>
					<p>

					<strong>Kiss</strong><br>
They met in the fields, the disapproving
looks from her parents
made him uneasy even if they kept
their distance , he didn’t know
what to do or how to tell her the
truth, he looked into her eyes for
one last time. He knew he won’t be
able to look into her eyes again;
she will be someone else’s. She
asked him why he called her here,
he lied by saying it’s just to see her
once before she returns to her
native for her marriage. Her eyes, no matter what he couldn’t
stop looking into them, they always told him a story. She nodded.
He turned his back on her and started walking away to hide
his tears, he looked back at her one last time. He could see those
tears, he knew he couldn’t walk away from her tears .He ran back
to her, he hugged and asked her what’s wrong, she leaned in and
kissed him and said now everything is fine.<br>
<strong>Kill</strong><br>
I was walking
through a forest.
My sword sharpened
and cleaned. I
could feel my bloodlust,
I had to keep
it in check. There
were four of them,
outcasts. Aiezel, my
General and my best
friend apparently
decided this was a
good time to just sit
down and have the
apples he stole earlier.
They mock me, they mock my bravery, their leader took out his
short sword. The fool thinks he has a chance, he thinks he will
get my respect with his wolf skin coat and his insignia which
just proves that he has killed some unlucky fat General eons ago.
I know that he is a rogue. I smirk at him. I look into eyes and
hide my thirst. I kneel to him. He starts bad mouthing my family,
the others just grunt and laugh along with him; after all he is
the boss. I realized it’s time for me to go hunting; I let out my
screeching laughter, my eyes depicting my madness. I thought of
my little kid, it’s his birthday maybe I should show them mercy. I
told the lot that I won’t kill anyone if they just leave and give
me the wolf skin coat. I don’t know why I asked for it, maybe it’s
because that a part of me knew he will refuse. That worthless fat
pig started to laugh, but I could feel the despair from others.
I had given them the chance. I still couldn’t let out the madness,
these pigs weren’t worthy of being in the demon’s presence,
they worthy enough to witness the hard; I looked at Aiezel, my
friend; he took out my sword and finished them all in seconds.
I think he too was feeling merciful, for if it was my dance then
the terror shall be spoken by the dead and nightmares shall be
spread. That bastard didn’t save me any apples though.<br>
<strong>Bite</strong><br>
I can feel the history and the pain. I can feel the dead. It’s so alive.
He showed me through the graveyard. We reached the house. It’s
not beautiful, it’s old, it’s ancient, yet it shows little hope. I decided
to go ahead, I bring my family. I know they will like it, they
will like everything
I like that’s their job.
Why are we walking
through the graveyard
in the night? Why
are we taking a house
which overlooks a
graveyard? Who is
this punk dude who is
showing me this place?
How did I even reach
here? My thoughts
were stopped when my
mom put her hand on
my shoulder and gave
me a reassuring smile.
We reached the house,
I looked at my cousin in time to see his neck meeting the fangs.
I could see the greed and feel the lust. Yet I had to follow my
primary instinct. I ran. My path blocked by another one. He looks
the same as the one who bit my cousin. Like the one who showed
me the house in the first place. Like me.<br>

					<h3>Bikers at Heart
<span>-vivek AN
5th ‘B’
</span>
 </h3>
					<p>
					
					<strong>“The Bengaluru Pulsar 220 owners club "Masked Bandits" is an Exclusive
group for the owners of the well established Pulsar 220.
We are people who believe in the equation 2>4, who also believe in and
promote "SAFE RIDING" as our PRIMARY MOTIVE.
Of course, there's no fun if the beasts inside these machines aren’t
unleashed, but every other aspect of biking is encouraged only with our
supervision in "CONTROLLED ATMOSPHERE"
</strong><br><br>
MASKED BANDITS was officially
started on 18th of JULY 2013.
The reason behind me starting
this group is my passion towards
biking and towards bikers who
shared the same roads with the
other bikers, in BANGALORE CITY.
The bitter fact which disturbed
and provoked me to take up an initiative
to start this biking club
was that the guys who owned
the Mighty pulsar 220 were more
considered as hooligans on the
road and unfortunately they actually
were in majority.
There were a major number of irresponsible
riders and daily commuters.
Hence i chose to make it
a point to contradict the wrong
image being developed by the irresponsible
individuals to that
of one of the most matured and
safe riders who can be an example
to the other bikers as well.
To this date, MASKED BANDITS
are 79 in number. All passionate
bikers from different age group,
different profile. Ultimately it’s
the brotherhood for which we
stand up. Biking for us is FREEDOM.
FREEDOM which
cannot be expressed by words or gestures
but only felt by a true biker. It’s
a whole new existence. Riding a
bike isn’t “JUST RIDING A BIKE” for
us. It takes a serene heart, a matured
mind and single existence
of a soul to evolve itself with
this purest of BONDAGE with
our bikes.
Our heart beats are the best music
ever played, ever heard of as
it Synchronizes with the beats of
our engines. We believe and work
towards the saying “ THE ONES
WHO KNOW HOW TO RIDE A BIKE
IS CALLED A RIDER. BUT ONLY A
MATURED RIDER CAN BE CALLED
A BIKER” We’ll celebrate every moment
of our lives, riding a million
more miles with smiles.

					<h3>WHAT ENGINEERING IS
ALL ABOUT???
<span>-MANOGNA.S
5th ‘A’

</span>

</h3>
<p>To the world
engineering is
an interface
between practical
applications
and pure
sciences. It is
an art or science
of making
practical applications
of the
knowledge of
pure sciences.
But from a
student’s point
of view the picture
is entirely
different. A student
in an engineering
college
is a pupa
transforming into a butterfly. This four year journey which
merely begins as a course transforms
into an ocean of experiences and
realizations.Everyone here comes
with a dream either big or small,
to get into a job or to become
an entrepreneur. But all of us
undergo
a process
where
fun and
frown
go hand
in hand.
We realize
the importance
of 35
marks, importance
of each
class
when attendance
drops below
65%
and of
last minute
study.
Importance
of mom
while eating
the
mess food
and of dad while standing in a
queue for paying our fees. Pride
of being a nerd when people ask
you for your assignments. Value
of money while grilled chicken
is hanging in front of us and we
are broke. Importance of a group
for projects. Value of a friend
for being partners in crime and
getting caught. Importance of
getting over a hangover for
next days class. Importance of
learning concepts while getting
screwed in viva and the list goes
on.All of us have a similar story.
We are engulfed in an ocean
of desires and ambitions and we
evolve, evolve into better human
beings. Engineering is not merely
a course to earn our bread and
butter but a life time experience.
So every engineer has his own
answer for WHAT ENGINEERING
IS ALL ABOUT….

	<h3>My lazy sunday
<span>-sushma ks
</span>
</h3>
<p>

There are certain things in life
you can never ever forget. Like
the aroma of the freshly brewed
early morning cup of coffee. Like
the sight of your father putting
on his shoes for a morning walk.
Like the melody of your mother
singing the praise of the almighty
lord. Exasperation, when
the pest of an elder brother
comes and tugs your blanket in
a futile attempt to awaken you.
The tranquil demeanor of the
soul, when you actually get up
and step out to the garden to
grab the newspaper. The morning
sun playing hide and seek with
the clouds, the chirping birds
flying away to make livelihood,
the nearly empty roads and the
calm neighborhood.
The only day, when your mother
makes beloved Masala Dose for
breakfast. The only day, when
you have the time to fight with
your brother wanting to be the
first one to read the newspaper,
talk to him about the latest
movie/ restaurant/phone/cricketer
that ultimately leads to a
big argument, which is cooled
off by the piping hot ghee laden
Masala Dose laid on the table.
About the time your father arrives
from his morning walk and
your mother joins the breakfast
table, and the conversation immediately
becomes intellectually
mature, ranging from politics to
stocks to gold price.
About the time at which ‘Kamalamma’,
the maid arrives with
her yellow and green wired basket,
and refuses to start moping
the house unless offered a
customary dose of coffee, leading
discreetly to my parent’s second
cup of coffee.
The only day, when your mother
finds explicit pleasure in forcefully
oiling your hair, while continuously
giving a sermon about
the principles of hair care, and
later complain about how you
miserably fail to pay any heed.
The only day when your mother’s
uncle makes his habitual visit, and
leaves you in splits, by mocking
everyone from your neighbor to
Narendra Modi; who is eventually
joined by your father’s pleasant
friend, and it’s time for another
cuppa.The only day, when
your mother nags you for more
than an hour until you finally
give in and take head bath before
lunch time. By the time you step
out of the shower, there is ‘Sunday
Special’ Bisi Bele Bath waiting
for you. The only day, when
you eat to your heart’s content
while watching the routine afternoon
lunch time movie. The
only day when you submit to your
crammed tummy and succumb to
an afternoon slumber with waking
dreams.
Yes, my typical lazy Sunday at
home. memories
